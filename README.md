As final exercise of the flexbox-foundations part of the Odin Project, I build a website as a copy of the given images.

Goal:
The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.


Additional information:
- I may use css rounded corners
- the font that is beeing used in the image is roboto
- "hero text" is the statement that appears at the top of a web page
- I will take each section once at a time
- the website hast 4 main sections and a footer
I will start at the top
-I will start with writing the html file and afterwards start designing css
- there is no focus on responsiveness and a good quality for mobile device!

Editor's note:
I will keep it as generic as possible and won't insert images or fancy things. My focus relies on developing this template and move on.
